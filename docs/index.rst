pynggdpp
========

The pynggdpp Python package contains all of the core logic for processing and working with collections of geological and geophysical data incorporated into the National Digital Catalog, a foundational resource provided for the National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program by the U.S. Geological Survey. The modules and functions in this package serve the needs of the data assembly process to build the catalog, but the tools can also be used in other contexts to interact with the online system.

ScienceBase
===========
The original version of the National Digital Catalog was built in `USGS ScienceBase <https://www.sciencebase.gov>`_, a cataloging and digital repository system. It is still the core of the NDC as a catalog, but the method for indexing items from the collections into an overall search index, API, and set of services has shifted to different technology. Read more about how ScienceBase works in the new architecture.
